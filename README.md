# serial-flash-kernel

This is for updating DSC's firmware using serial communication interface(SCI).

You shall import these source files to Haawking IDE(at least V0.0.9) and build it. Then you will get the elf file.

With ```hex2000.exe``` and ```hex_32bit_align.exe```, you will get the txt format kernel file used by Haawking's serial flash tool.
